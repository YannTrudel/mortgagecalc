Mortgage Calculator to help me check the options

## Running Tests

This project includes a small set of unit tests for the core calculator logic.
Run them using Node's built in test runner:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests also run automatically via GitHub Actions when pushing or opening pull requests against `main`.
